# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis system to classify text data as positive or negative. The model is developed from scratch using Keras and TensorFlow, leveraging deep learning architectures like embeddings, convolutional layers, and LSTMs to achieve efficient and accurate classification.

The provided Python notebook demonstrates the complete pipeline for training and evaluating the sentiment analysis model. It includes data preprocessing, embedding integration, model architecture implementation, training loop, and evaluation functionality. The notebook also showcases the use of GloVe pre-trained embeddings to enhance the model's performance on sentiment classification tasks.
